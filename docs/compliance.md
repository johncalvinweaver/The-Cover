# Compliance & Responsible Gaming

_The Cover_ is committed to responsible gaming, transparency, and compliance. This public preview uses only mock data.

## Principles

- **Transparency**: All projections, odds, and line moves are documented and versioned.
- **Responsible Gaming**: This project does not enable or facilitate real-money betting. All data is for informational and educational purposes.
- **Data Sourcing**: Mock data only. Production integrations will document all sources and comply with regional regulations.

## Next Steps

- Geofencing and user access controls for real data
- Ongoing responsible gaming toolkit development
